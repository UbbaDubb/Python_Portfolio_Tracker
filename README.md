Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker in Python

Disclaimer!
<br> This is not financial advice and shouldn't be taken as such. I am not a professional adviser and this is solely for educational purposes or for those who already invest in the highly volatile cryptocurrencies at their own risk, and wish to utilise to keep track of their trades. For those interested in using this, be aware of the limitations highlighted at the end. 

After investing some of my money in cryptocurrencies before properly researching crypto exchanges, I came upon the problem that I did not wish to cash in on the assets I was already holding, in order to put the money in a better suited crypto exchnage for me. However, if I were to keep the cryptocurrency assets in the old exchanges and keep investing in the new and more tailed for me exchanges, I would then have to flip through different apps to calculate the performance of my overall crypto portfolio. 

Thus I decided to write this very short code, which calulates my current profit/loss based on the assets I hold. The code is very short and only requires a csv spreadsheet file, which it reads to calculate the amount of each asset still owned up-to-date. Through very simple functions, it then calculates the Â£GBP value of each asset, though of course this can be changed to different currencies.
